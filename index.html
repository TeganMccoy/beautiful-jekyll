## Welcome!

Hi, I’m Tegan McCoy. I’m pursuing my Master’s degree in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics at Arizona State University. 
This site is part of my coursework for PAF 514 and also a space where I experiment with coding, data visualization, and design.  


I’m especially interested in Program evaluation methods and Data-driven decision making using R, Python, and visualization tools.
I aspire to one day apply analytics to healthcare and public service challenges
