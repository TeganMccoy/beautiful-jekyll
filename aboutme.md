## Hello, I’m Tegan 🪷

I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in **Program Evaluation and Data Analytics** at **Arizona State University**. This portfolio site is part of my coursework for PAF 514, and also a place to share my growth in evaluation, research design, and data visualization.  

My academic and professional interests include:
- Program and policy evaluation  
- Quantitative and qualitative research methods  
- Regression analysis and causal inference (my favorite!)  
- Data visualization in **R** and **Python**  
- Public service and evidence-based decision making

## Beyond Academics
Outside of school and research, I enjoy:
- Creative design and sewing (festival clothing, accessories, and custom apparel)  
- Music festivals and live events 🎶
- - Flow arts and fire dancing 🔥🪭
- Spending time with my family and exploring new projects 🌸
